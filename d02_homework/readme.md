# Homework

In this homework, you will create a new github account.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a social network for developers. It allows anyone to create repositories (or projects)
and share them with others.

Git is a version control tool that allows you to manage repositories.

Repositories are made up of:

- commits
  - these are like snapshots of your entire project at some point in time.
- branches
  - branches are labels for commits. They are how we reference a snapshot and the snapshots that precede it.
  - typically each feature of a project will have its own branch.
- remotes
  - these are just links to other copies of your project.
